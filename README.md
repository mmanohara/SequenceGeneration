# SequenceGeneration
All the HMM helper functions are in HMM.py and HMM_helper.py. These are mostly
specific to the HMMs, but occasionally feature elements such as punctuation or list
generation. Syllable and Rhyme implementations in Final_HMM.

The character based RNN described in section 4 of the report is in character_RNN. The
improved RNN that is word based (described in section 6) is in word_RNN.
